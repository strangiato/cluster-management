# Cluster Bootstrap

This project is still a work in progress.

The intention is that this will allow you to easily bootstrap an ArgoCD instance to a new cluster which will then instantiate several operators on the cluster.

## Components

AMQ-Streams
ArgoCD
OpenShift Container Storage
OpenDataHub
OpenShift Pipelines
Serverless
